# Data_Preprocessing

The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate the core concepts and techniques of data preprocessing, including handling missing data, data transformation,
encoding categorical data, and feature scaling, among others.

The dataset used for this project is small, thus it's an excellent way to quickly understand the steps involved in preprocessing.
The small size of the dataset allows for detailed examination of every step, which might be overwhelming with larger datasets.
